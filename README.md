# image-sort

Sorts the pixels in an image, for no good reason.

Inspired by [I Tried Sorting Pixels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMmmBDRy-jE), but doesn't currently do the more interesting effects discussed there.

## Development

This project has no runtime dependency, but uses three dependencies for development:

- Biome: Used for linting and formatting
- vite: Used only as a development server
- typescript: Used for typechecking jsDoc and .d.ts. No runtime code is written in typescript
